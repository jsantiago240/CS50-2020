# CS50-2020
This is a collection of my old repositories for Harvard's 2020 CS50 Intro to CS course.

I did not finish the 2020 program because I took a break to get my EMT Certification. CS50 2021 will be my new goal.

All users are welcome to view my solutions if they need help for a CS50 project. Please cite my repository if you use actual code from my projects in your CS50 projects.
